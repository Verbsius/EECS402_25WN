//Programmer: Andrew Morgan, Yiting Wang
//Approximate date: April 15th
//Purpose: A simple class to represent event objects that can be used in
//         an event-driven simulation.  The overloaded insertion operator
//         for this class ties it to a simulation of traffic flow through
//         an intersection managed by a traffic light, but the rest of
//         the class is intended to be more generic to represent events
//         in most event-driven simulations.

// Implementation of overloaded comparison operators for EventClass
