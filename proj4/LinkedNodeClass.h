// Purpose: 
// This file contains the header file for the LinkedNodeClass.
// This class is a linked node that contains a value and pointers to
// the previous and next nodes in the list. The class contains
// methods for getting the value, getting the previous and next
// nodes, setting the previous and next pointers to NULL, and
// setting the previous and next pointers to point to this node.
