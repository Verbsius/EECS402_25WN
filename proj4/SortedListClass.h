// Purpose:
// This file contains the header file for the SortedListClass.
// This class is a linked list that is sorted in ascending order.
// The class contains methods for inserting, removing, and printing
// the elements in the list. It also contains methods for getting
// the number of elements in the list and getting the element at
// a specific index.
